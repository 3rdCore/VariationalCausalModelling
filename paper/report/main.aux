\newlabel{fig:assumption}{{2}{3}{Illustration of the necessity of the assumption considered on the data-generation process. a). \textbf {Single Target / Uniq. Intervention}: The regime $\mathcal {I}_1$ can't be the observational regime $\mathcal {O}$ because this would break the interventional-Faithfulness assumption ($\mathcal {I}_2$ would then correspond to a intervention made on marginal $p(x_1)$ which should also alter the marginal of its descendent: $p(x_2)$, which is not what we observe). $\mathcal {I}_2$ can't be $\mathcal {O}$ because this would break the single target assumption (In $\mathcal {I}_1$, while the marginal $p(x_1)$ has changed, $p(x_2)$ remain not affected. For this to be possible is to have performed an intervention on $p(x_1)$ and one on $p(x_2|x_1)$ to cancel out the effect of the first one on $p(x_2)$). Therefore, the only possible observational regime is $\mathcal {I}_3$. b) \textbf {Multiple Target / Uniq. Intervention}: Here we add another regime $\mathcal {I}_4$ targeting both $p(x_1)$ and $p(x_2|x_1)$. In this case, the regimes become completely symmetric and the observational regime can't be identified. c) \textbf {Single Target / Non-Uniq. intervention}: Here we add another regime $\mathcal {I}_4$. In this case, $\mathcal I_1$ and $\mathcal {I}_4$ have symetric role and the observational regime once again can't be identified}{figure.2}{}}

\newlabel{fig:architecture}{{3}{4}{Architecture of the variational Auto-Encoder. An encoder takes as input the data $x$ and outputs the parameters of the approximate posterior categorical distribution $q_\phi (z | x)$. The sampled discrete latent variables $z$ are then fed to the decoder that outputs the parameters of the likelihood distribution $p_\theta (x | z)$. During backpropagation, the discrete latents are approximated using the Gumbel-Softmax reparametrization trick. For more details on the architecture of the likelyhood model $p_\theta (x | z)$, we refer to Figure \ref {fig:architecture_decoder}}{figure.3}{}}
